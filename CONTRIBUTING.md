# Contributing to IV&V Framework for BCI Safety-Critical Systems

## Overview

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the IV&V Framework for BCI Safety-Critical Systems. This project follows NASA IV&V methodologies adapted for medical device software validation, and all contributions must meet strict safety and quality standards.

## Safety-Critical Development Guidelines

⚠️ **CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE** ⚠️

This framework is designed for safety-critical BCI systems that may interact with neural tissue and patient safety systems. All contributions must:

1. **Follow safety-critical development practices**
2. **Maintain MISRA C++ compliance**
3. **Include comprehensive testing**
4. **Document safety implications**
5. **Undergo rigorous review**

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements

- **MISRA C++ Compliance**: All C++ code must follow MISRA C++ guidelines
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 95% code coverage for safety-critical components
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation for all public APIs
- **Static Analysis**: Code must pass static analysis without warnings
- **Safety Assertions**: Include appropriate safety checks and assertions

### Coding Standards

```cpp
// Example of safety-critical code structure
namespace IVVFramework {
namespace SafetyExample {

/**
 * @brief Safety-critical function with proper error handling
 * @param input Input parameter with validation
 * @return Result with error checking
 * @pre input must be within valid range [0, MAX_VALUE]
 * @post result is validated before return
 */
SafetyResult safety_critical_function(const ValidatedInput& input) noexcept {
    // Input validation (defensive programming)
    if (!input.is_valid()) {
        return SafetyResult::INVALID_INPUT;
    }
    
    // Safety assertion
    assert(input.value >= 0 && input.value <= MAX_VALUE);
    
    // Protected operation
    try {
        auto result = perform_operation(input);
        
        // Output validation
        if (!validate_result(result)) {
            return SafetyResult::INVALID_OUTPUT;
        }
        
        return SafetyResult::SUCCESS;
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        // Log safety violation
        log_safety_violation("Operation failed", e.what());
        return SafetyResult::OPERATION_FAILED;
    }
}

} // namespace SafetyExample
} // namespace IVVFramework
```
