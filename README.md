# IV&V Framework for BCI Safety-Critical Systems

A comprehensive Independent Verification & Validation toolkit specifically designed for embedded Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems operating in safety-critical environments. This framework provides modular verification capabilities including fault injection, regression testing, and timing analysis tailored for the unique requirements of neural implant and surgical robot systems.

## 🧠 Overview

This IV&V framework addresses the critical safety requirements of BCI systems like those used in Neuralink's surgical robots and neural implants. Drawing from NASA IV&V methodologies, it provides systematic verification and validation capabilities for embedded systems that interact directly with neural tissue.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- QNX Software Development Platform 7.0+
- GCC 9+ or Clang 10+
- Python 3.9+
- CMake 3.16+

### Building the Framework

```bash
# Clone and navigate to project
cd ivv-framework-bci

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure for QNX target
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/qnx.cmake ..

make -j$(nproc)

# Run verification tests
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### Basic Usage

```cpp
#include "ivv_framework/core/verifier.h"
#include "ivv_framework/fault_injection/fault_injector.h"

// Initialize IV&V framework for BCI device
auto verifier = IVVFramework::Core::Verifier::create("neural_implant_v2");

// Configure fault injection for signal processing pipeline
auto fault_injector = IVVFramework::FaultInjection::FaultInjector::create();
fault_injector.configure_target("signal_processor");
fault_injector.inject_timing_fault(100, TimeUnit::MICROSECONDS);

// Execute verification scenario
auto results = verifier.execute_scenario("critical_path_timing.dsl");
```
