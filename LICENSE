## SAFETY-CRITICAL SYSTEM DISCLAIMER

⚠️ **IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICE** ⚠️

This software is designed for verification and validation of Brain-Computer 
Interface (BCI) safety-critical systems. While provided under the MIT License, 
users must understand and accept additional responsibilities when using this 
software for safety-critical applications:

### REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
- Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable medical device 
  regulations (FDA, CE marking, etc.)
- This software does not guarantee regulatory compliance
- Independent validation and verification may be required for clinical use

### SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
- This framework is intended for development and testing environments
- Never use fault injection capabilities on production systems with patients
- All safety-critical applications must undergo proper hazard analysis
- Users must implement appropriate safety monitoring and fail-safe mechanisms

### MEDICAL DEVICE USE
- This software has not been cleared or approved by any regulatory authority 
  for clinical use
- Integration with actual BCI devices requires extensive validation
- Clinical applications must follow appropriate medical device development 
  lifecycle processes (IEC 62304)

### QUALITY MANAGEMENT
- Users implementing this in medical device development must establish 
  appropriate quality management systems (ISO 13485)
- Risk management processes (ISO 14971) must be applied
- Software lifecycle processes must be followed

### NO WARRANTIES FOR SAFETY-CRITICAL USE
While the MIT License provides the software "as is" without warranty, users 
of safety-critical systems must understand that:

- No warranty is provided for safety, reliability, or fitness for medical use
- Users assume all responsibility for safety validation
- Independent testing and verification are required
- Professional engineering oversight is recommended

### RECOMMENDED PRACTICES
When using this software for safety-critical BCI systems:

1. Conduct thorough hazard analysis
2. Implement redundant safety mechanisms
3. Perform extensive testing and validation
4. Follow applicable medical device standards
5. Maintain comprehensive documentation
6. Establish proper change control processes
7. Conduct regular safety reviews

By using this software, you acknowledge that you understand these additional 
responsibilities and agree to use the software in accordance with applicable 
safety and regulatory requirements.

For questions regarding safety-critical use or regulatory compliance, consult 
with qualified regulatory affairs and clinical engineering professionals.
